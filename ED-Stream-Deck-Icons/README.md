# Elite Dangerous Stream Deck Icons

A set of icons for use with the [Elite Dangerous Stream Deck Plugin](https://github.com/mhwlng/streamdeck-elite) for the Elgato Stream Deck.

This is a complete icon set for all the supported actions (excluding static buttons) as of version 2.7.3.0.

These icons are heavily inspired by maximilianyuen's icons ([Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/EliteDangerous/comments/g4u7f1/stream_deck_with_elite_didnt_even_know_this_is/)), but designed from scratch with updated colours to better match the Elite UI and a profile which gives a cleaner look when displayed on the Stream Deck buttons.

I've aimed for a consisten look across all of the icons, with the top text showing the function and dynamic outputs (where avaiable) and the buttom bar showing the current status.

This has been tested on the Stream Deck XL. Results on other Stream Decks may vary, but you are welcome to adjust these icons if required.

The icons were drawn in [Affinity Photo](https://affinity.serif.com/en-gb/photo/) and the .afphoto template file has been included. This is paid software, but they do offer a free trial.

## Fonts

The font used for all of these icons is [Rubik](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Rubik), available for free from Google Fonts.

This font can be downloaded and installed for making your own custom icons.

Unfortunatley, custom fonts cannot be loaded into the Stream Deck software. The closest match available is Tahoma at an 11pt font size. Alternatively, you can create custom icons with Rubik and use these.

## Colours

The colours uses for the icons are as follows:

These can be input into the colour selector in the Stream Deck software to enable you to match the pips, numbers and text to the icon colours.
